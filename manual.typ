Welcome to the Situated Health and Biology (SHAB) Laboratory at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile!
It's great to have you!
The lab is led by Dr. Tomás González Zarzar and his goal as a Principal Investigator (PI) and mentor is to foster a safe, inclusive, and challenging environment were all lab members can reach their full potential as scientists.
We hope that you'll learn a lot about human biology, develop new skills, and have fun in the process.

This lab manual has been inspired by several others (e.g.).
If you have any ideas on how to improve it, for example, things you'd have liked to know at this moment, feel free to share them with the PI.

When you join the lab, you're expected to read the manual.
If you have any questions, or you need clarification on any aspect of the manual, feel free to contact Tomás.
The intention of the manual is to have clear expectations of our, and each other's roles, and to provide a starting point for a positive lab environment.
Such positive environment will also require active investment and refinement of our interactions over time.

= About the lab

This is a lab were we value the science that we do; we are making progress in fundamental questions on human health, and human biology more broadly.
Our work involves mainly computational biology, even though, once in a while we will dip or toes back to the wet lab.
As a computational biology lab, we take huge care in the way we develop our analysis pipelines, from planning the analysis, to writing the code, sharing, publishing, and maintaining it.
We don't expect everyone joining the lab to already be proficient in programming, but an interest in learning such topics is required.

= Getting started

If you want an early start, here are some basic tutorials were you can learn some basic skills that we’ll be useful throughout your stay at the SHAB lab:

- #link("https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/")[Version control with Git]
- #link("https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/")[Programming with Python]
- #link("https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/")[Programming with R]
- #link("https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-fair-research/")[FAIR data and software (Pre-alpha)]

= Expectations and responsibilities
== Everyone <everyone>
- Science is challenging, but can be fun and hugely rewarding.
  Work on topics that you're passionate about; it's okay to switch topics if you feel the current one doesn't "speak" to you.
  If the topic is part of your dissertation, make sure you have plenty of time to start another project from scratch.
- Double and triple check all your work.
  It's easy to make mistakes, but harder to spot them.
  Make other lab members to check your analyses.
  Distribute replication instructions widely, and make sure others get the same results.
  If you made a mistake, make sure to tell your collaborators, it doesn't matter if the paper is submitted or under review; it's better to admit a mistake, correct it, and move on.
- We do honest work.
  Academic misconduct is a hard line in our lab.
  We don't plagiarize, tamper, fabricate, or omit data in any way.
  We don't carry out millions of tests to select only a few that show statistical significance.
  Null and unexpected results are part of our work and are a valuable part of the scientific endeavor.
- Help others.
  Help your lab mates, colleagues, and classmates.
  Expect them to help you when you need it.
  Science is about collaboration and not competition.
- If you are struggling, let us know.
  We are all here to help.
  Someone might have a valuable lesson if they have experienced similar things.
- In case of conflict among lab members, tell Tomás, he can mediate or can refer to the appropriate conflict resolution unit within the University.
- Stay up to date with the latest research on you area.
  You can set up RSS feeds, Google Scholar alerts, or getting journals TOC.
- Science is our job, but not our life.
  We encourage having a life outside the lab and its responsibilities; take care of your mental and physical health and well-being.
  It's okay to take time off work.
- *Small things:*
  - If you are sick, stay home and take care of yourself.
    Reschedule meetings if needed.
  - You are not expected to work during holidays, weekends, or stay up late.
    You _are_ expected to get the work done (whatever time of the days works best for you).
  - Show up to your meetings, classes, and appointments.
    You don't need to be 9-5 in the lab, but you need to work the hours to get stuff done.
  - Be on time for everything, including meetings and classes.
    Everyone's time is valuable.

== Principal Investigator
All of the @everyone, plus:
- Support you and care for your well-being.
- Give you feedback on project ideas, conference papers, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants.
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss research progress.
- Support your career development by giving you advice, introducing researchers, promoting your work, facilitating collaborations, writing recommendation letters, and support conference travel.
- Help you prepare for your next step of your career, whether it's graduate school, post-doc, faculty job, or a job outside academia.

== Graduate students
All of the @everyone, plus:
- Develop your dissertation research.
  Even though most of you dissertation will be done independently, collaboration is a huge part of it.
  Remember that other people in the lab are here to help you if you need it.
- Help mentor undergraduate students.
- Present your work at intramural events, other labs, and conferences.
- Apply for grants.
- Think about your career (academia, industry, something else).
- Meet your deadlines, and communicate them to Tomás.
- Prioritize time for research.
  Coursework are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares for the next stages of your career.

== Undergraduate students
All of the @everyone, plus:
- Assist lab members with data collection, cleaning, and analysis, unless you have your own independent project under the mentorship of another lab member, in which case, that's your priority.
- Organize you week, so you have enough time to attend your classes, study, and get the lab work done.
- Present your work at intramural events, other labs, and conferences.

= Code of conduct

= Lab resources
== Communication
We use Teams and e-mails for most communication.
Except under specific circumstances including emergencies, we don't share our personal phone numbers with each other, nor we communicate through WhatsApp.

== Weekly updates
We use Updates from Teams to share updates with Tomás, which should be uploaded each Friday.
These updates should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, including a bullet list of what you've done in the week, and what are you planning for next one.
Any specific help you need should be shared through here.
