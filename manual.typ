Welcome to the Situated Health and Biology (SHAB) Laboratory at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile!
It's great to have you!
The lab, led by Dr. Tomás González Zarzar the Principal Investigator (PI), aims to foster a safe, inclusive, and intellectually stimulating environment where all members can reach their full potential as scientists.
Our goal is for you to expand your knowledge of human biology, develop new skills, and enjoy the journey.

This lab manual has been inspired by several others.
If you have suggestions for improvements--especially things you wish you had known when starting out--please share them with the PI.

Reading this manual is an expectation for all new lab members.
If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to reach out to Tomás.
The purpose of this document is to establish clear expectations, define roles, and lay the foundation for a positive and collaborative lab environment.
Maintaining such an environment requires active participation and continuous improvement in how we interact with each other.

= About the lab

We take pride in the science we conduct, addressing fundamental questions in human health and broader aspects of human biology.
Our research primarily focuses on computational biology, though we occasionally engage in wet lab work.
As a computational lab, we emphasize rigorous analysis pipelines--from planning and coding to sharing, publishing, and maintaining our work.
While prior programming experience is not required, an interest in learning computational methods is essential.

= Expectations and responsibilities
== Everyone <everyone>
- Science is challenging but should also be rewarding and enjoyable.
  Work on topics you are passionate about.
  If your current project doesn't resonate with you, consider switching (especially if it's part of a dissertation, but consider the time it takes for a new project to get started).
- Double- and triple-check your work.
  Mistakes are easy to make but harder to detect.
  Have others verify your analyses and ensure that replication instructions yield the same results.
  If you made a mistake, make sure to tell your collaborators, it doesn't matter if the paper is submitted or under review; it's better to admit a mistake, correct it, and move on.
- Maintain scientific integrity.
  We do not plagiarize, falsify, manipulate, or omit data.
  Selective reporting of significant results is unacceptable--null and unexpected findings are a valuable part of the scientific endeavor.
- Collaborate and help others.
  Support your labmates, colleagues, and students.
  Science thrives on collaboration, not competition.
- Seek help when needed.
  If you are struggling, let someone know.
  Others may have insights or solutions from similar experiences.
- Report conflicts.
  If conflicts arise, inform Tomás for mediation or guidance toward the appropriate resolution process at the University.
- Stay updated on research in your field.
  Set up Google Scholar alerts, RSS feeds, or journal TOC notifications.
- Maintain work-life balance.
  Science is our job, not our entire life.
  Take care of your mental and physical health.
  Time off is encouraged.
- *Small things:*
  - If you are sick, stay home and prioritize your health.
    Reschedule meetings if necessary.
  - You are not expected to work on holidays, weekends, or late nights.
    However, ensure tasks are completed in a schedule that works best for you.
  - Show up to your meetings, classes, and appointments.
    You don't need to be 9-5 in the lab, but you need to work the hours to get stuff done.
  - Be punctual for meetings, classes, and appointments.
    Everyone's time is valuable.

== Principal Investigator
All expectations under @everyone, plus:
- Support lab members and care for their well-being.
- Provide feedback on research ideas, conference presentations, manuscripts, figures, and grant proposals.
- Be available for meetings and email correspondence on a regular basis.
- Support career development through mentorship, networking, collaboration opportunities, recommendation letters, and conference funding.
- Guide lab members in preparing for their next career step (graduate school, postdoc, faculty positions, industry, etc.).

== Graduate students
All expectations under @everyone, plus:
- Develop dissertation research.
  While much of this work is independent, collaboration is vital.
  Lab members are available to support you.
- Help mentor undergraduate students.
- Present research at intramural events, external labs, and conferences.
- Apply for grants.
- Plan for your career path (academia, industry, or other fields).
- Meet deadlines and communicate them clearly to Tomás.
- Prioritize research.
  Coursework is important, but research is what ultimately earns you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.

== Undergraduate students
All of the @everyone, plus:
- Assist lab members with data collection, cleaning, and analysis.
  If you have an independent project under mentorship, that should be your priority.
- Manage your time effectively to balance classes, studying, and lab responsibilities.
  Nevertheless, your priority should be your classes.
- Present research at intramural events, external labs, and conferences.

= Code of conduct
Coming soon.

= Lab resources
== Communication
We primarily use Microsoft Teams and email for communication.
Except in emergencies, we do not share personal phone numbers or use WhatsApp for lab matters.

== Weekly updates
Lab members submit weekly updates via Microsoft Teams (Updates) every Friday.
These should take no more than 10 minutes to complete and should include:
- A brief bullet-point summary of tasks completed that week.
- Plans for the upcoming week.
- Any specific areas where you need support.

Regular updates help maintain accountability, track progress, and ensure timely assistance when needed.
